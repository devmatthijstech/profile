Hello, I'm Matthijs Liethof, a self-taught programmer who has delved into various programming languages throughout my journey. Although I didn't follow a traditional educational path in programming, my passion and dedication led me to explore different realms of software development. I lean towards typed languages and have a strong inclination towards devops, with hands-on experience in Azure and Kubernetes.

Currently, my focus lies primarily on .NET development, where I continue to expand my skills and knowledge. Engaging with the developer community is something I truly enjoy, and I actively contribute as an organizer at [Nimma.codes](https://nimma.codes).

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of leading teams and applying an elastic leadership style. I believe that effective leadership involves adapting to the needs of the team and the project, being flexible in approach, and fostering an environment of collaboration and innovation.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the countryside on my motorcycle, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or spending quality time with my cat and girlfriend. Compassion and empathy are values that are close to my heart, and I strive to embody these qualities in both my personal and professional life.

I firmly believe that software is not just a means to an end, but a powerful tool to create meaningful impact on businesses and people. For me, it's not enough to simply write code; it's about understanding the needs of businesses and individuals, and leveraging technology to drive positive change.

Delivering working software in production goes beyond just writing good code. It involves cultivating strong team habits, such as automated testing, code quality checks, security practices, and observability. I firmly believe that a high-performing team is one that collaboratively tests hypotheses and embraces a holistic perspective. By fostering these habits, we can create reliable software that truly meets the needs of users and makes a tangible impact.

Join me on this blog as we explore the fascinating world of software development, discuss industry trends, uncover the secrets to building exceptional teams, and learn about the application of an elastic leadership style, all with the ultimate goal of making a real and meaningful impact.
